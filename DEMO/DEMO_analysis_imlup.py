DEMO_analysis_imlup.py

PURPOSE:
    Script that loads in data and models for IM Lup, and then finds the model/wall combination with the lowest chi^2
    
INPUTS:
    In order for this script to run properly, you will need to change the paths to the correct directory.
    If using this file as a template for other objects, it is likely that you will need to change it according to your needs.
    
    If you want to save the plot that this script creates, set 'save' to True.
    
OUTPUTS:
    Produces a plot with the model/wall with the lowest chi^2, along with a list of all the chi^2 + model numbers and best fitting wall heights.
    
NOTES:
    This script is supposed to act as a simple example of how to use EDGE for analysis, but is definitely not the rule. Significant changes will
    likely need to be made in order to analyze your objects.
